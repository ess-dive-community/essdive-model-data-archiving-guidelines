# ESS-DIVE Model Data Archiving Guidelines

These guidelines were informed through engagement with the U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental System Science (ESS) land modeling community. We distributed and synthesized repository user-feedback forms to develop a white paper ([Simmonds et al, 2020](https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/acdk4)) that summarizes the community needs for model data archiving and ESS-DIVE's response to supporting those needs. A key finding was that the primary need for most researchers is to archive model data associated with publishing journal articles to meet journal and funding requirements. In response, we interviewed researchers to assess their current practices for archiving model data for journal articles. A manuscript is currently being written that presents all of these findings and the resulting recommendations for the following guidelines.  While these guidelines are the culmination of the aforementioned efforts, they will evolve over time based on ongoing community engagement and feedback received here.
